### Hi there! Welcome to my profile. 👋🏻

First of all, I love coding! Since I was 12 years old I have programming in my life. It all started with wanting to know how MMORPG games work. At that time, I didn't know that it would become my job, and even more, make money from it.

I started going through several startups where I had a very big growth. I passed through several areas until I found myself. Frontend is my passion.

I love creating systems that millions of people can use. I feel the need to show the best UX/UI to my users. It is very important for me, to be able to feel the pain of users and to improve their experiences even more.
